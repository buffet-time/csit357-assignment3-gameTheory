Assignment 3 - Game Theory


Assignment 3 – Implementation of Game Theory

This assignment focuses on gaming concepts in AI. Students are required to implement any 2-player game in a programming language of their choice such as C or Java. You could consider a deterministic or stochastic game. Some examples of 2-player games are listed below.

Tic-Tac-Toe (Deterministic)
Chess (Deterministic)
Backgammon (Stochastic)
Card Games, e.g., Blackjack for two (Stochastic)
The program requirements are as follows.

Initial State – indicates how the game is set up at start
Players – defines which player has a move in the state
Actions – returns the set of legal moves in a state
Results – determines the outcome of a move
Utility – gives the payoff with numeric values for each player
Your implementation must cover all these. It is not required to develop a GUI in the program. It is sufficient to show the execution of the game with respect to the program requirements above. You are allowed to reuse some code from games online if needed, with citation and modify parts it with your own implementation to suit the requirements of your game in this assignment. Please show clearly the parts you reuse along with the appropriate citation and also the parts you actually implement. 

Draw a game tree for your program and analyze the performance of the players with utility values. State the evaluation functions wherever applicable. You should use either Simple Minimax or Alpha Beta Pruning or Monte Carlo Simulation here, as found appropriate. This analysis should be done by you in theory, and also implemented within the program wherever necessary with the goal of making a given player win. Again, some code reuse is permitted here with citation as long as you show what part you implement.   

Students are requested to work in teams for this assignment. An in-class presentation with slides is required on the due date which shows the input, processing and output in the program with respect to the given program requirements. Describe the initial state, players, actions, results and utility. Also please explain the rules of your game in the introduction on the slides. Around 5 minutes will be allotted per team for their presentation. The source code with a live demo or its snapshots can be shown. Please include all references used including sources of code reused, if any. No written report is needed for turn-in, but the students must submit hard copies of the slides. PLEASE DO NOT IMPLEMENT SINGLE-PLAYER GAMES OR MULTI-PLAYER GAMES WITH 3 OR MORE PLAYERS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT. ONLY 2-PLAYER GAMES NEEDED.

 Please note that you will get 10 points each for: game implementation (reuse & actual), adverserial search techniques ( game tree, minimax etc., reuse & actual), explanation on slides (with rules, intial state, players, citations etc...) & demo (live / snapshots). So please devote your time accordingly towards the assignment.
